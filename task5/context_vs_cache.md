Context is a new addition to laravel 11

context and cache serve different purposes in the developer experience.

cache is used to store the result of a computation and reuse it later, for instance a result of an expensive db query.

Context on the other hand is very handy to store and maintain data that needs to be shared between http requests or queued jobs. it could be a setting coming from the config file, that could be serialized into the queued job, or as stated in laravel docs, contextual information about the reqeust, like authenticated user id can be added to the logs.
